Down To The Wire
================

This is the online version of the [Mega Poster Talk](http://agilecambridge.net/ac2014/sessions/index.php?session=36) I gave at Agile Cambridge 2014.

It tells the story of a project to build a 'video postcard' maker through the artifacts created and
pinned to the Project Wall during the two weeks of this fixed date, fixed cost project.

You can play with it on [GitHub pages](http://worldofchris.github.io/down-to-the-wire/).
